##### I currently plan to create a bank of 5000 random questions per test,      #####
##### which requires 25 distinct generators per test as they appear below. So,  #####
##### 75 total genrators for a semester of three tests. Once finished with      #####
##### individual generators, I will begin function wrapping, creating either a  #####
##### single function with many adaptive arguments, or a suite of functions.    #####

##### These will help streamline test writing, requiring only that one runs the #####
##### code to replace the test banks at least once per year. The longest part   #####
##### of the process is waiting on the e-learning uploads of the CSVs so-created. ###                                                               #####

##### 6/25 Generators for test 1 completed  #####
##### 0/25 Generators for test 2 completed  #####
##### 0/25 Generators for test 3 completed  #####

#### 0/75 Generators wrapped into functions #####

##### n is the number of questions desired, answers is the number of answers    #####
##### per question, points.per.q are the points assigned to each question,      #####
##### difficulty is the difficulty assigned to each question, and type is the   #####
##### question's category (all as listed on e-learning. I've labeled the        #####
##### questions by concept, e-learning type, and creation of the concept/type   #####
##### pair. For example, MeanMC1 is a generator for my first very simple        #####
##### multiple choice question about a mean.                                    #####
