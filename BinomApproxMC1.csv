"QuestionText","A brewery pulls 951 bottles of beer to sample them for quality control. In the past, there has been a 0.16 probability that a randomly selected bottle of beer is defective. Assuming this trend continues (independence), what is the probability that 152 or fewer bottles of beer in this particular sample are defective?",""
